# Spring Project Template

I've created this repository just to serve me as a simple reference of how to configure following functionalities in Spring projects:

* Spring MVC with REST service
* Hibernate HSQL database connection
* Internationalization based on the database MessageSource
* Dependency Injection
* EJB Startup Bean
* No tests, shame on me :)

Note: this example contains only **xml-based** configurations. [Here](https://github.com/andriyboychenko/spring-proj-template-no-xml) is the link for the same project template but with annotation based configurations.

To run this application, install Jboss AS 7.1.1 and modify deploy-script.bat if necessary.

To test the internationalization, the Locale of the browser should be changed. See the following image:
