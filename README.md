# Spring Project Template

I've created this repository just to serve me as a simple reference of how to configure following functionalities in Spring projects:

* Spring MVC with REST service
* Hibernate HSQL database connection
* Internationalization based on the database MessageSource
* Dependency Injection
* EJB Startup Bean

Note: this example contains only xml-based configurations. In future I'll create a branch with annotation based configs

To test the internationalization, the Locale of the browser should be changed. See the following image:
